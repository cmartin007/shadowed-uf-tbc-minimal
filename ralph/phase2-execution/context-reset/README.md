# Context reset – Fresh start after each task

From the infographic: *Context wiped clean after every task to remove "garbage" decisions.*

**Policy:** See **`CONTEXT-RESET.md`** in this folder for the full policy: what we wipe (agent session, prior-task prompt), what we keep (backlog, progress.txt, repo), when we reset (before each new task), and how to do it for human chat, Cursor agent, or an automated loop.
