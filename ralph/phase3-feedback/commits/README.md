# Commits – Automated git commits

From the infographic: *System commits passed tasks for future query history.*

**Policy:** Document here when to commit (e.g. after each task that passes guardrails, or after each feature). RULES.md already requires updating phase CHANGES.md before commit; this folder can define automation or message format (e.g. “Phase2: <feature-id> – <one-line>”).
