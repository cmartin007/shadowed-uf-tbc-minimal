# Guardrails – Type-check & unit tests

From the infographic: *Must pass feedback loops before considered complete.*

**In this project:** **`./build/build.sh`** runs luacheck (fails on errors). Phase **`phaseN/test/checklist.md`** must be run in WoW before setting `passes: true` for a feature.

Use this folder for: guardrail scripts, CI config (e.g. run build on push), or docs on what “pass” means (lint clean, checklist items N–M done).
