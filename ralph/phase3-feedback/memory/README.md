# Memory – Persistent findings & logics

From the infographic: *Persistent memory via progress.txt* – e.g. “Findings: Pattern X in module Y…”, “Logics: Quirk Z…”, “Threeings: …”.

Use **`progress.txt`** (in this folder) or similar to log patterns, gotchas, and inferences so future runs can reuse them. Append after each task or feature; keep format simple (date, section, line).
