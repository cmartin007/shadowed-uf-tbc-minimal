# Slicing – Tiny tasks for small context

Rules and examples for breaking a backlog feature into **one agent-sized task** (one file, one concern, clear acceptance).

Canonical guide: **`docs/ralph/slicing-guide.md`**.

Use this folder for: extra examples, slice templates, or scripts that consume the backlog and output next slice.
