# Backlog – Structured feature list

The **canonical backlog** is **`docs/ralph/backlog.json`** (feature id, passes, scope, dependencies).

**Grooming:** Before picking the next task, groom the backlog with the human (clarify scope, order, deps, agree on "next"). See **`docs/ralph/GROOMING.md`**.

Use this folder for: exports, backups, or alternate views of the backlog. Do not duplicate the source of truth; link to `docs/ralph/backlog.json`.
